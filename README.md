## üöÄ Gatling Simulation Configuration

### HTTP Protocol Configuration

- **Base URL**: `https://regres.in/api`
- **Accept Header**: Configured to accept JSON responses.

### Test Scenarios

1. **Get User Request**

   - **Objective**: Test the GET `/users?page=2` endpoint.
   - **Validation**: Response status `200` and saved user IDs.

2. **Create User Request**

   - **Objective**: Test the POST `/users` endpoint.
   - **Validation**: Response status `201` with correct user data.

3. **Get Single User Request**

   - **Objective**: Test retrieval of a single user's data.
   - **Validation**: Response status `200` and matching user ID.

4. **Invalid Create User Request**
   - **Objective**: Test server validation with invalid data.
   - **Validation**: Response status `400` (Bad Request).

### User Load Configuration

- **Valid Scenarios**:
  - `rampUsers(100).during(60)`: Gradual increase to 100 users within 1 minute.
  - `constantUsersPerSec(50).during(120)`: Constant 50 users per second for 2 minutes.
- **Invalid Scenarios**:
  - Lower load with 20 initial users and 20 stable users.

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

### API Response Validation

- All scenarios return expected status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`).

### Performance Stability

- API handles simulated load without significant errors.

### Data Accuracy

- API outputs match the inputs provided in POST requests.

## üìä Key Metrics

1. **Response Time**: Average and maximum response time per endpoint.
2. **Throughput**: Number of successful requests per second.
3. **Error Rate**: Ratio of failed to total requests.
4. **Stability Metrics**: Evaluate performance under high load.
